# Trust Compass  
### The missing lens in high-stakes human decisions

---

## Why we built this

You’ve been there.

A founder gives the perfect pitch. They say all the right things. The numbers make sense. But something still feels… off. Or maybe the opposite — they’re raw, real, and unpolished, but your gut says they’re the one.

This product was born in that moment.

**Trust Compass** helps you decode what your intuition is already trying to tell you — by extracting psychological signals from how people talk, react, and handle pressure.

We don’t care about charisma. We care about coherence.  
We don’t measure likability. We measure **truth under tension**.

---

## What it does

Trust Compass analyzes real human interactions — like Zoom calls, messages, and interviews — and shows you patterns you’d normally only catch after months of working with someone.

- How do they handle stress?
- Do they take responsibility or deflect?
- Are their answers consistent when it matters?

It’s not about judgment. It’s about clarity.  
A second opinion for your gut — structured, visual, and fast.

---

## Who it’s for

Right now, this is built for **investors** — especially early-stage VCs and angels — who make calls based not just on data, but on *people*.

Later, it’ll expand to:
- Hiring teams
- Cofounder assessments
- Founders doing self-reflection

If your decisions depend on who someone *really is*, this is for you.

## What it feels like

We didn’t want this to feel like “AI.”  
We wanted it to feel like stepping into a room with better light. You see the same person — just more clearly.

There’s no clutter. No unnecessary charts.  
Just signal. Just insight. Just the truth, surfaced gently.

## How it works

1. **Upload a conversation** — a Zoom call, transcript, or Slack thread.
2. (Optional) Use our **prompted test** — a few questions that reveal how someone handles pressure.
3. We analyze for:
   - Emotional regulation
   - Deflection patterns
   - Linguistic drift
   - Accountability signals
   - Possible biases/traumas
   - Tendencies of psyche and context around.
4. You get a clean, visual **Founder Profile** with:
   -for now,only psychological portrait example output here --> ![outputs.md](outputs.md)
   coming in a future:
   - Trust Lens summary
   - Emotional timeline
   - Key moments and quotes
   - Comparison tools

## Integrates with your workflow

- Export clean summaries to PDF or Notion
- Share insights with partners, silently
- Embed into your CRM or decision notes

You don’t need to change how you work.  
You just see more clearly when you do it.

---

## What it’s not

- ❌ It doesn’t give people a “score”
- ❌ It doesn’t replace your gut
- ❌ It’s not surveillance

This is a tool for **human-first decision makers**.  
It works because you still make the call.

---

## Current status

We’re in private MVP mode.  
Working closely with a handful of early-stage investors to refine the signal and the experience.

## Bonus: how we think

We don’t build features. We extract essence.

If you’re curious how we think about product, we’ve included our design algorithm as a mental model:  
→ [`mental_model.mmd`](./mental_model.mmd)

It shows how every decision loops back to one question:  
**“What should this feel like for the user?”**
